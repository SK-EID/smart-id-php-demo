# CHANGELOG

## 0.30.0

 * ~~[BC BREAK] The Vue "build" was changed from `vue.esm.js` (full build) to `vue.runtime.esm.js` (runtime build)~~
   This was reverted in Encore 0.30.1.

 * [DEPENDENCY UPGRADE] `sass-loader` was upgraded from version 7 to 8.
   See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#800-2019-08-29)
   for breaking changes. This likely will not affect you unless pass
   custom options to `Encore.enableSassLoader()`: several options were
   moved or renamed - #758 thanks to @Kocal.

 * [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] Encore now resolves loaders directly from its
   `node_modules/`, instead of by name. This change will cause a behavior
   change if you do any of the following:

   * Add a different version of a loader (that Encore embeds) into your
     `package.json`: the different loader won't be used anymore.

   * Require a package that also included one of our embedded loaders:
     depending on which one was hoisted it could result in a different
     behavior.

   * Manipulate the generated config and filter loaders based on their
     names: the comparison won't be the same anymore

   See #739 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * [DEPENDENCY UPGRADE] Webpack minimum version was changed from
   `4.20.0` to `4.36.0` - see #746 and #758.

 * [DEPENDENCY UPGRADE] Upgraded `clean-webpack-plugin` from `^0.1.19` to `^3.0.0`.
   You should not notice significant changes unless you use
   `Encore.cleanupOutputBeforeBuild()` and pass custom options.
   For more info, see [v1 to v2 upgrade notes](https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin/issues/106)
   and [v2 to v3 upgrade notes](https://github.com/johnagan/clean-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v3.0.0).
   There were no changes from `0.1.19` to `1.0.0`. See #760 thanks to @weaverryan.

 * Encore will now correctly recognize a project-wide `babel.config.js` file - #738
   thanks to @jdreesen.

 * [DEPENDENCY UPGRADE] The `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` package was upgraded for the tests
   from `^0.4.1` to `^4.0.0`. If you're using `enableForkedTypeScriptTypesChecking()`,
   you control the `fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin` version in your
   `package.json` file. You should upgrade to `^4.0.0` to ensure
   that the plugin works correctly with Encore. See
   [fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/TypeStrong/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin)
   for details about the changes. See #759 thanks to @weaverryan.

 * Added support for Vue3 - #746 thanks to @weaverryan.

## 0.29.0

 * Support for Node 8 was dropped.

 * [BC BREAK] Several loader dependencies we upgraded across major versions.
   These won't affect most users, but could affect you if you have custom
   configuration for those loaders that changed between versions:

   * `css-loader` upgraded from version 2 to 3 - #729 thanks to @weaverryan.
     [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300-2019-06-11)
     This shouldn't affect most users - you are most likely to be affected
     if you're using `Encore.configureCssLoader()`.

   * `style-loader` upgraded from 0.21 to 1.1  - #710 thanks to @Grafikart.
     [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100-2019-08-06)
     Unless you're doing custom configuration, it's unlikely you're affected.

   * `file-loader` upgraded from 1.1 to 6  - #731 thanks to @weaverryan.
     [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#600-2020-03-17)
     If you are importing images/fonts using the CommonJS syntax (`require('foo.png')`),
     you will now need to explicitely retrieve the default export (`require('foo.png').default`)
     in order to get the path of the file.
     Imports done using the `import` keyword should not be affected.

   * `url-loader` upgraded from allowing version 1 or 2 to allowing version 4 - #731 thanks to @weaverryan.
     [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/url-loader/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#400-2020-03-17)
     Unless you're doing custom configuration, it's unlikely you're affected.

 * [BC BREAK] If you're using `enableEslintLoader()`, Encore no longer
   configures eslint for you: you now *must* configure your own
   `.eslintrc.js` file. If this is missing, you'll now get a nice
   error about this telling you how to fix it - #687 thanks to @Kocal.

 * Added `Encore.enableBabelTypeScriptPreset()` to "compile" TypeScript with
   Babel, which is a more performant option than `ts-loader` - #694
   thanks to @Kocal.

 * Added `Encore.configureDevServerOptions()` as an easy way to configure
   dev-server options - #693 thanks to @Kocal.

 * Added `Encore.addCacheGroup()` method as an easy way to add custom
   caching groups - #680 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Include the .pcss extension for PostCSS files - #718 thanks to @opdavies

 * Added `Encore.configureStyleLoader()` to configure the `style-loader` - #715
   thanks to @tooltonix.

 * Added `lintVue: true` option to `Encore.enableEslintLoader()` to explicitly
   turn on linting of Vue files (which requires  the `vue-eslint-parser`
   package) - #574 thanks to @Kocal.

## 0.28.0

 * Don't make `@babel/preset-env` use `forceAllTransforms` option
   in production - this will reduce build size in production
   for environments that only need to support more modern
   browsers - #612 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Added support with `enablePostCssLoader()` to process files
   ending in `.postcss` or using `lang="postcss"` in Vue - #594
   thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Allow `resolve-url-loader` to be configured via `enableSassLoader()` -
   #603 thanks to @diegocardoso93.

 * Support was removed from Node 9 (a no-longer-supported version
   of Node) - #585 thanks to @weaverryan

 * [BC Break] Removed the ability to use `[chunkhash]` in
   `configureFilenames()`, which was already deprecated and
   no longer reliable - #608 thanks to @Lyrkan.

## 0.27.0

 * [Behavior Change] The Babel configuration `sourceType` default was
   changed from not being specified (so, the default `module` was used)
   to `unambiguous`. This is to help Babel's `useBuiltIns` functionality
   properly determine if a `require` or `import` should be automatically
   added to your files, based on that file's style - #555 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Added JSX support to Vue! #553 thanks to @Kocal.

 * Cleaned up the jsdoc in `index.js` to add better docs and better
   IDE auto-completion - #550 thank sto @Lyrkan.

## 0.26.0

 * [Behavior change] The Babel `useBuiltIns` option default value changed
   from `entry` to `false`, which means that polyfills may no longer be
   provided in the same way. This is due to a change in Babel and core-js.
   To get the same functionality back, run `yarn add core-js --dev`, then use:

   ```js
   Encore.configureBabel(() => {}, {
       useBuiltIns: 'entry', // or try "usage"
       corejs: 3
   })
   ```

   This comes from #545 thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Added the ability to "resolve" CSS and Sass files without specifying
   the file extension and by taking advantage of the `sass` or `style`
   attribute in an npm package. For example, you can now import the main
   Bootstrap SASS file from within a SASS file by saying `@import ~bootstrap`.
   This will use the `sass` attribute from the bootstrap `package.json`
   file to find which file to load. #474 thanks to @deAtog.

 * Added a new `Encore.enableIntegrityHashes()`, which will cause a new
   `integrity` key to be added to `entrypoints.json` with integrity values
   that can be included in the `script` or `link` tag for that asset - #522
   thanks to @Lyrkan.

 * Allow some parts of `configureBabel()` to be used, even if there is
   an external `.babelrc` configuration file - #544 thanks to @Lyrkan.

## 0.25.0

 * [BC BREAK] Various dependency versions were updated, including
   `css-loader` updated from `^1.0.0` to `^2.1.1` and `resolve-url-loader`
   updated from `^2.3.0` to `^3.0.1`. The minimum Node version was
   also bumped from 6 to 8. See #540 for more details.

 * Added `Encore.disableCssExtraction()` if you prefer your CSS to
   be output via the `style-loader` - #539 thank to @Lyrkan.

 * Added `Encore.configureLoaderRule()` as a way to configure the
   loader config that Encore normally handles - #509 thanks to @Kocal.

 * Babel cache is no longer used for production builds to avoid a
   bug where the cache prevents browserslist from being used - #516
   thanks to @Lyrkan.

## 0.24.0

 * Add CSS modules support in Vue.js for Sass/Less/Stylus - #511
   thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Allow to use Dart Sass instead of Node Sass - #517 thanks to
   @Lyrkan

 * Allow to set a custom context in copyFiles - #518 thanks to
   @Lyrkan

 * Improve 'Install x to use y' and 'Unrecognized method' error
   messages - #520 thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Allow to set @babel/preset-env's useBuiltIns option - #521
   thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Allow setOutputPath to create nested directories - #525 thanks
   to @Lyrkan

## 0.23.0

 * Add support for CSS modules in Vue - #508 thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Store externals in an array - #495 thanks to @deAtog

 * Add `Encore.isRuntimeEnvironmentConfigured()` - #500 thanks
   to @stof.

 * Add the ability to configure watch options - #486 thanks
   to @Kocal

 * Enabled cache and parallelism for terser for faster builds -
   #497 thanks to @Kocal

## 0.22.0

 * [BC BREAK] The values/paths in entrypoints.json were previously
   stripped of their opening slash. That behavior has been changed:
   the opening slash is now included: Before: `build/foo.js`, After: `/build/foo.js`.

## 0.21.0

 * [BC BREAK] Webpack was upgraded to version 4. This includes a number of major
   and minor changes. The changes are listed below under the
   `Webpack 4 Upgrade` section.

 * [BC BREAK] The `createSharedEntry()` no longer can be passed an array of files.
   Instead, set this to just one file, and require the other files from inside that
   file.

 * [DEPRECATION] You must now call either `Encore.enableSingleRuntimeChunk()`
   or `Encore.disableSingleRuntimeChunk()`: not calling either method is
   deprecated. The recommended setting is `Encore.enableSingleRuntimeChunk()`.
   This will cause a new `runtime.js` file to be created, which must be included
   on your page with a script tag (before any other script tags for Encore
   JavaScript files). See the documentation above `enableSingleRuntimeChunk()` in
   `index.js` for more details.

 * [BEHAVIOR CHANGE] Previously, without any config, Babel was
   configured to "transpile" (i.e. re-write) your JavaScript so
   that it was compatible with all browsers that currently have
   more than 1% of the market share. The new default behavior
   is a bit more aggressive, and may rewrite even more code to
   be compatible with even older browsers. The *recommendation*
   is to add a new `browserslist` key to your `package.json` file
   that specifies exactly what browsers you need to support. For
   example, to get the old configuration, add the following to
   `package.json`:

```json
{
    "browserslist": "> 1%"
}
```

See the [browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) library
for a full description of all of the valid browser descriptions.

 * Added a new `copyFiles()` method that is able to copy static files
   into your build directory and allows them to be versioned. #409
   thanks to @Lyrkan

 * Introduced a new `configureSplitChunks()` method that can be
   used to further configure the `optimizations.splitChunks` configuration.

 * A new `entrypoints.json` file is now always output. For expert
   use-cases, the `optimizations.splitChunks.chunks` configuration
   can be set via `configureSplitChunks()` to `all`. Then, you
   can write some custom server-side code to parse the `entrypoints.js`
   so that you know which `script` and `link` tags are needed for
   each entry.

 * The "dynamic import" syntax is now supported out of the box
   because the `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` babel plugin
   is always enabled. This allows you to do "Dynamic Imports"
   as described here: https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/#dynamic-imports

 * A new "version check" system was added for optional dependencies.
   Now, when you install optional plugins to support a feature, if
   you are using an unsupported version, you will see a warning.
   "Package recommendation" errors (i.e. when you enable a feature
   but you are missing some packages) will also contain the version
   in the install string when necessary (e.g. `yarn add foo@^2.0`).

 * Support was added `handlebars-loader` by calling `enableHandlebarsLoader()`.
   #301 thanks to @ogiammetta

 * Support was added for `eslint-loader` by calling `enableEslintLoader()`.
   #243 thanks to @pinoniq

 * The `css-loader` can now be configured by calling `configureCssLoader()`.
   #335 thanks to @XWB

 * It's now possible to control the `exclude` for Babel so that you can
   process certain node_modules packages  through Babel - use
   the new second argument to `configureBabel()` - #401 thanks to
   @Lyrkan.

## Webpack 4 Upgrade Details

 * Node 7 is no longer supported. This is because the new
   `mini-css-extract-plugin` does not support it (and neither)
   does Yarn.

 * For Preact, the necessary plugin the user needs to install
   changed from `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx` to `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`.

 * The NamedModulesPlugin was removed.

 * The `babel-preset-env` package (which was at version ^1.2.2) was
   removed in favor of `@babel/preset-env`.

 * ExtractTextPlugin was removed and replaced with
   mini-css-extract-plugin. Accordingly, `extractTextPluginOptionsCallback()`
   was removed.

 * Support for CoffeeScript was entirely removed.

 * Actual lang="sass" no longer works for Vue. However, lang="scss"
   continues to work fine.

 * uglifyjs-webpack-plugin was replaced by terser-webpack-plugin.
   If you're using `configureUglifyJsPlugin()`, please switch to
   `configureTerserPlugin()` instead.

 * Fixed several minor bugs related to extra `.map` files (#170),
    always having a DefinePlugin enabled (#172), fixing extra
